# Required Libraries for Pomodoro Timer ESP32-C6

## Core Display Libraries
- **TFT_eSPI** (by Bodmer) - Version 2.5.43+
  - Primary library for controlling the ST7789 display driver
  - Provides graphics rendering, text, shapes, and image support
  - Install via: Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO

- **LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) - Version 9.0.0+
  - Optional but recommended for advanced GUI features
  - Provides widgets, animations, and modern UI elements
  - Install via: Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO

## Graphics Support
- **Adafruit GFX Library** - Version 1.11.9+
  - Graphics primitives and drawing functions
  - Required dependency for some display libraries

- **Adafruit BusIO** - Version 1.14.5+
  - I2C/SPI communication abstraction layer
  - Required dependency for Adafruit libraries

## LED Control
- **FastLED** - Version 3.6.0+
  - Control for onboard RGB LED
  - Useful for visual notifications during pomodoro sessions

## Installation Methods

### Using PlatformIO (Recommended)
The `platformio.ini` file in the root directory contains all dependencies.
Simply run: `pio lib install` or let PlatformIO install them automatically.

### Using Arduino IDE
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
3. Search and install each library listed above
4. Make sure to install dependencies when prompted

## Configuration Notes

### TFT_eSPI Configuration
After installing TFT_eSPI, you may need to edit the library's `User_Setup.h` file:
- Set the correct display driver (ST7789)
- Configure pin assignments for your ESP32-C6 board
- Adjust display resolution (240x320 for 1.47 inch)

### LVGL Configuration
If using LVGL, configure `lv_conf.h`:
- Set memory pool sizes
- Enable/disable features as needed
- Optimize for ESP32-C6 resources
